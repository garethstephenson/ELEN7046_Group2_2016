	\section{Introduction} % Major section
	
This document covers a significant amount of deliverables that are key to the delivery of most projects that follow a formalized and structured software development lifecycle.
\\
\\
Deliverables covered in this topic are in the main architectural in nature with greater focus on High Level Design deliverables such as requirements, component model and Sequence Diagram(s) (Software Architecture), and Operational Model/ Physical Infrastructure Design.

% \subsection{Problem Statement}

%\subsection{Solution Summary}

% XXX

\subsection{Approach}

The project shall be delivered by firstly trying to understand the requirements and modeling them into a set of Use-Cases which can then be used to direct the project from analysis to design, development, validation and verification, and benefits tracking once the system is taken into production and starts adding value to its end-users.

%\subsubsection{Methodology}
	
		%\subsection{Executive Summary} % --optional
		
		%------------------------------------------------
		
	\subsection{Background}
	This project was conceptualized to solve for a problem that is one of the key problems for both businesses and academic institutions as we move forward into this new world that is at the cutting edge of innovation and extreme levels of data available.
	
	The scope of the project shall be limited to acquiring data from Twitter (based on topic subscriptions - in this case, US and SA elections data for 2016), taking it through the process of transformation and analysis, and later making it available to users in a meaningful way using some of the cutting edge visualization tools that are relevent to solving the problem at hand.

	%	MAJOR SECTION 1
	\section{Lifecycle Methodology}
	
	The initial assessment of the project based on the project description and high level requirements showed the team that the project to be delivered can be classified as low-to-medium in terms of the classification scheme for projects based on the following broad categories:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Low -} This means the project to be delivered is classified as having low complexity and either small/ small-to-medium in terms of the budget and size of the delivery team.
		\item \textbf{Medium -} This means the project is classified as having medium complexity with medium budget and delivery team-size.
		\item \textbf{High -} This mean that the project is classified as being fairly complex, and requiring a huge budget and workforce for the success of its delivery.
	\end{itemize}
	
	It was for the reason of small-to-medium classification that the project followed a formal, plan-driven approach for the delivery of this project, based on IBM RUP with tailoring in order to make a determination/ up-front decision regarding the artifacts that were to be de-scoped, delivered at a level of detail sufficient to allow for the next phase(s) to continue, or to deliver a comprehensive artifact.
	\\
	\\
	The diagram below depicts the IBM RUP model[1]:
	
		\begin{figure}[H] % Example image
			\center{\includegraphics[width=1.15\linewidth]{ibm1}}
			\caption{IBM Rational Unified Process (Source: RUP, Best Practices for Software Development Teams)}
			\label{fig:speciation}
		\end{figure}
	
		\section{Assumptions and Constraints}
		
		\textbf{Assumptions:}
		
		The key assumptions made for this project are as follows:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is assumed that all the resources required to deliver this project are available and will be dedicated to the project from inception to transition.
			\item It is also assumed that the infrastructure planned for this initiative will be able to cater for the anticipated volumes.
		\end{itemize}

		\textbf{Constraints:}
		
		The following are the constraints identified during High Level Design:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Limitation of the source system for the provision of social media and location data for non-commercial purposes.
			\item Time related constraints for the delivery of a working solution by the end date.	
		\end{itemize}
		
		\section {Design Decisions}
		
	The key design decision that was made in this project related to the tailoring of RUP artifacts in order to ensure success in the delivery while pitching the content of the deliverables at a sufficient level of detail to enable down-stream teams to continue with their work.
	\\
	\\
	The other major decision made was that of allowing for development as well as parts of production systems to run independent from each other and at different geographical areas to ensure continuity, and contribute to project service level characteristics of high availability and disaster recovery, albeit, not fully disaster recovery proof. 
	
    \section{Requirements - Use Case Models}

	\section{Solution Design}
		
	\subsection{High Level Design: Component Architecture}
	
	The high level design below depicts the key functions of the Twit-Con-Pro solution with special focus given to components relating to acquisition, processing and visualization of Big Data from Twitter that relates to both the American and South African elections for the year 2016.
	
		\begin{figure}[H] % Example image
			\center{\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{HLD1}}
			\caption{High Level Component Model.}
			\label{fig:speciation}
		\end{figure}
	
	The table below provides a descriptive detail of all the key components that make-up the solution from data acquisition through to visualization.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ | l | p{12.7cm} |}
			\hline     	
			\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Key Function of Component} \\
			\hline
			Twitter & This component is the key provider of social media data for analysis and processing based on topics subscribed to. For this project, it was decided that topics subscribed to be centered around top political parties in the US and RSA elections.\\
			\hline
			TwitterRESTAPI & Twitter exposes a REST API for those interested in its publicly available data to integrate into their systems and acquire the data. Some limitations around how much data can be retrieved at any given time are imposed.\\
			\hline
			JAX-RS for Twitter & This solution, through this project shall deliver an interface based on JAVA API for XML Representational State service in order to integrate into Twitter for the acquisition of history data based on a date range.\\
			\hline
			Twitter Integration & This component is responsible for integrating into Twitter, orchestrating the validation and resolution of location information to Geographical Co-ordinates where location details are available as part of Twitter user preferences and persisting all the data on MongoDB.\\
			\hline
			Streaming Component & The standalone, windows based component shall also provide the same functionality as the Twitter Integration component; however, in this case, data being acquired shall be fresh data, streamed live as it happens.\\
			\hline
			MongoDB & This open source database was used for storing all the Big Data acquired from Twitter, both history data and online streaming data.\\
			\hline
			FTP Site & Periodically, a job shall be run to extract the data in the database and transfer it to the in JSON files for further processing on the Raspberry Pi cluster.\\
			\hline
			Data Processing & This component is dedicated to doing all the number crunching using Apache Spark while applying principles of MapReduce to ensure that all the Big Data is split and shared amongst all the Raspberry Pi cluster worker nodes.\\
			\hline
			Node.JS Presentation & This component shall read all the processed data and render it in a Web Browser in a manner that tries to communicate to the user the sentiments of potential voters for the upcoming 2016 elections in both the United States and South Africa.\\
			\hline
			Web Browser & The user interacts with the data using the Web Browser.\\
			\hline
			User & It is important to note that the user in this instance represent both the end-user who is interested in the elections analytics from Twit-Con-Pro and the admin-user who is responsible for the initial setting up of topics that are to be subscribed to.\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Operational Model: Infrastructure Design}
	
	As the title of the report suggests, this project is envisaged to leverage the use of low cost, commodity hardware in order to make a case for participating in Big Data projects without having to rely on big budgets and enterprise platforms.
	\\
	\\
	The below diagram depicts the production view of the end-to-end solution. In this diagram, it can be shown that the solution was running at completely separate geographical locations, even though at the heart of it (the number crunching and data analysis) all the nodes participating in the cluster were co-located at one geographical area.
	
		\begin{figure}[H] % Example image
		\center{\includegraphics[width=1.15\linewidth]{OM1}}
			\caption{Operational Model: Phyical}
			\label{fig:speciation}
		\end{figure}
	
	The breakdown of the solution at an operational level was as follows for the production environment:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{History\ Batch Data -} All batch data acquisitions from Twitter will be based in Centurion. Data acquired from Twitter shall be persisted in a MongoDB locally in that physical geographic are to avoid latency.
		\item \textbf{Streaming Data -} Streaming data shall be processed from the North-Riding location while data persistence is done locally to that site using MongoDB as well.
		\item \textbf{Aggregation and Visualization -} Most of the data "heavy-lifting" and number crunching shall happen using a cluster of Raspberry Pi's which are a very small pocket-sized "servers". The location information has been deliberately left out in this scenario because this part of the solution has been designed with high-mobility in mind.
	\end{itemize}
	
	%	CONCLUSION
	
	\section{Conclusion} % Major section
	
	All this hardware and software is available to anybody interested in Big Data processing.\\
	
	The hardware is cheap and the software is free.\
	
	The learning curve in the beginning can be quite steep but is ultimately very rewarding in terms of what can be achieved with so little financial investment.
